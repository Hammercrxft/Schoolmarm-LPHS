### Schoolmarm for LPHS Project
# Contributor Code Of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Our pledge? Our promise? All I know is that I promised to keep all written
code for this project be stored here for safekeeping. Just as I did, 
please do the same with your own progress.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that will slight, stain, tarnish, and/or damage
this repository's usefulness and approachability include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
  outside of code comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could dishearten the team's will to type out code that
  could eventually turn into very useful ones and zeroes.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the only one responsible for enforcement at
hammercroft@pm.me -- the owner of the repository.

Investigation, handling, and judgement is at the owner's discretion.
