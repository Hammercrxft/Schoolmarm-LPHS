# Schoolmarm-LPHS
A school registry system software for use with one or more computers.
This is school project, tailor-made for another school. It's nothing much.

Uses webpages as its user interface, naively implemented via an http server.

# Notes
Only works in Windows.
Requires Java 11 or higher.
Currently requires a Chromium installation folder in C:\SchoolmarmRegistryData, named `chrome-win`
